# satay

A delicious clojure based SAT solver.

### Background

Prerequisite information on SAT solvers.

SAT solvers are programs that reduce boolean expressions into a true or false state.  
They evaluate expressions and find whether they can be evaluated or not.

Given the example, a AND NOT b, if a is TRUE and b is FALSE then the expression can evaluate as true.  
Because of this we say the boolean expression, a AND NOT b can be satisfied.

### TODO
more terminology
